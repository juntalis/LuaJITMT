# JIT Recursive Return Trace Retention

2026-07-05

- Current `v2.1` no longer reproduces the old endless `TRACE 1`
  re-recording failure on `fib30`. Both `tests/stock/bench/recursive-fib.lua`
  and `auxiliary/bench/bench.lua fib30` finish and publish an up-recursion trace.
- There is still a trace-shape/performance gap against stock: the fork records
  and retains more early `LJ_TRLINK_RETURN` roots before the up-recursion graph
  stabilizes. A typical direct `fib(30)` probe showed several live return roots
  before the up-recursion root, while stock tends to reuse earlier slots sooner.
- The relevant path is `check_call_unroll()` calling
  `lj_trace_flush_unlink()`. That unlink is intentional: replacing it with
  scoped retirement reopens the older correctness bug where `trace_abort()`
  cannot see the return trace and install the stock blacklist edge.
- A local experiment added an `unlink+retire return` helper and tried both:
  retiring only return-start aborts, and retiring every unlinked return trace.
  The focused gates still passed, but `-jv auxiliary/bench/bench.lua fib30` continued
  allocating fresh return-trace numbers during the abort burst, and timing did
  not improve. The experiment was reverted.
- GDB confirmed the helper was reached with a root return trace and a
  single-thread/no-worker state, and that the immediate release path restored
  `J->freetrace`. The remaining gap is therefore not just "forgot to clear the
  slot"; it likely involves the surrounding abort/retry/penalty sequence and
  when subsequent recording starts relative to the slot release.

Useful commands:

- `LUA=luajit tools/ci/lua_test.sh m6_jit_recursive_call_unroll`
- `LUA=luajit tools/ci/lua_test.sh m6_jit_flush_hs`
- `env LUA_PATH="$PWD/src/?.lua;$PWD/src/?/init.lua;;" src/luajit -jv auxiliary/bench/bench.lua fib30`

Next attempt:

- Instrument or expose a focused test-helper counter for call-unroll aborts,
  return-trace unlink, self-link blacklist, slot release, and immediate next
  `trace_findfree()` choice. Fix the trace-number reuse only after that sequence
  is observable in one C fixture.

Follow-up fix:

- Added `LJ_TRACE_TEST_HELPERS` telemetry plus
  `tests/t-jit-recursive-retention.c`. The first measurement showed the
  workload had `return_unlinks=55`, `abort_selflinks=0`, `slot_clears=0`, and
  55 live return traces after warmup. In other words, the call-unroll aborts
  were not using the root stitched-call self-link path that needs the old return
  trace to stay in its public slot.
- `check_call_unroll()` now keeps the unlinked return trace only for the exact
  `trace_abort()` branch that can install the stock self-link blacklist:
  root recording, non-return start bytecode, and a nonzero invoking trace. Other
  call-unroll aborts use `lj_trace_flush_unlink_retire_return()`, which unlinks
  the return trace and retires its slot through the normal trace SMR path.
- The focused fixture now reports `slot_clears=9`, `returns=0`, and no
  self-link use for the recursive workload. A `-jv auxiliary/bench/bench.lua fib30`
  sample showed trace slot 3 reused for the up-recursion trace after two
  call-unroll aborts, instead of retaining a run of live return roots.
- Follow-up coverage tightened `tests/t-jit-recursive-retention.c` so the
  fixture now checks both a static recursive local function and the
  `auxiliary/bench/bench.lua fib30` shape where the recursive closure is rebuilt
  around each measured run. The assertions are deliberately stock-shaped:
  call-unroll aborts may vary with hotcount jitter, but they must stay bounded
  at 32, every unlinked return trace must clear its public slot, at least one
  released trace slot must be reused, and the stock self-link branch must remain
  unused. The benchmark-shaped case may leave a small live return trace for the
  wrapper; the static recursive body still finishes with zero live
  `LJ_TRLINK_RETURN` roots.
