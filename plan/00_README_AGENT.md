# LuaJIT-MT: Lockless Multithreaded LuaJIT — Implementation Report

## 00. READ ME FIRST — Operating Instructions for the Implementing Agent

### Current execution plan (2026-09-04)

Read [15_lockless_completion.md](15_lockless_completion.md) for the current
requirements, verified gaps, dependency order, and completion evidence. It
supersedes conflicting platform restrictions, unsafe algorithm sketches, and
stale implementation-status claims below and in documents 01–14. Those
documents remain the architecture and semantic reference; their dated bridge
notes are not proof of the current implementation or of completion.

The supported scope is x86-64 Linux, macOS, and Windows. User-facing blocking
operations may block by contract, and `ffi.cdef` may serialize its writers;
ordinary runtime operations must make progress while a peer is suspended.
Replacing a peer-dependent spin with a sleep does not meet that requirement.

Execution order, per the user's 2026-09-04 instruction: focus implementation
and testing on Linux until the next release is ready. Revisit macOS/Darling and
Windows/Wine before releasing; they remain in the final product scope.

This is the entry point of the implementation specification plus
auxiliary code. It tells you exactly how to consume the rest, what the ground
rules are, and how to verify your work at every step.

### 0.1 What you are building

A fork of LuaJIT v2.1 in which multiple OS threads execute Lua code in
parallel against **one shared heap** (one `global_State`), with:

- a **lockless runtime**: no mutexes anywhere on hot paths of the
  interpreter, JIT-compiled code, allocator, or GC; coordination is done with
  atomics, per-thread ownership, soft handshakes, and cooperative lock-free
  protocols (precise definition of "lockless" in `02_memory_model.md` §2.2);
- a **fully concurrent GC**: on-the-fly (no global stop-the-world) parallel
  mark & sweep, derived from Mike Pall's LuaJIT 3.0 arena GC design and the
  FUGC/DLG family of on-the-fly collectors;
- **full JIT support**: tracing, trace execution, side traces, FFI on trace —
  all while other threads run;
- **full Lua semantics** including shared mutable upvalues across threads
  (via the "cell" upvalue model, `06_concurrent_objects.md` §6.4);
- a `threading.*` standard library (spawn/join/channels/etc.,
  `09_threading_api.md`);
- **current lockless bytecode loading** (`BCDUMP_VERSION 4` chunks load and
  run; stock-compatible v2/v3 dumps still load when they do not contain
  lockless-only cell opcodes, but loaded legacy functions are not re-dumped as
  current chunks; see `10_bytecode_compat.md`).

### 0.2 Pinned source

All file names, line numbers, struct fields and function names in these
documents were verified against:

    repo:   https://github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT.git  branch v2.1
    commit: b925b3e3fc6771171602323b45fbe9fb8fc90369
    ident:  "LuaJIT 2.1.1780076327"

If you work from a different commit, treat every cited line number as
historical orientation and re-derive the affected worklist from the current
code before editing. Lasting coverage must be behavioral, fixture-based,
counter-based, stock-suite based, or tied to public artifacts such as captured
process output, benchmark CSVs, bytecode load/execute payloads, release metadata,
or packaging output. Implementation constraints belong in code-adjacent
comments and notes that explain the ordering, ownership, nonblocking, or ABI
reason.

### 0.3 Reading order

Read the current execution plan first, then the architecture in numeric order
once before changing its protocols; revalidate affected sections against code
on later passes:

    00_README_AGENT.md            (this file)
    01_architecture_overview.md   architecture + all binding decisions (ADRs)
    02_memory_model.md            atomicity rules; the lj_atomic.h layer
    03_runtime_state_split.md     global_State / GG_State / per-thread TG block
    04_allocator.md               lock-free arena allocator (replaces lj_alloc)
    05_gc_concurrent.md           the concurrent GC (largest document)
    06_concurrent_objects.md      tables, strings, upvalue cells, misc objects
    07_interpreter_vm.md          vm_x64.dasc changes (safepoints, barriers, ops)
    08_jit_compiler.md            recorder token, trace publication, mcode, IR
    09_threading_api.md           threading.* library spec + implementation
    10_bytecode_compat.md         BCDUMP v4, new opcodes, current dump handling
    11_ffi_concurrency.md         CTState, cdata, callbacks, native regions
    12_implementation_plan.md     milestone playbook M0..M10 — YOUR TASK LIST
    13_testing_and_benchmarks.md  baselines, harness, stress/litmus tests, TSAN
    14_risks_alternatives_bibliography.md
    15_lockless_completion.md    current scope, corrections, and acceptance

Use document 15's current dependency order, with `12_implementation_plan.md`
as the milestone inventory. Each milestone names its tasks, the
documents/sections that specify them, the
tests that gate completion, and what to do if a gate fails.

Auxiliary code shipped with this report (under `auxiliary/`):

    auxiliary/lj_atomic.h          complete atomics layer — drop into src/ as-is
    auxiliary/arena_bitmap_model.c standalone, tested model of the arena bitmap math
    auxiliary/nbtab_model.c        standalone, tested model of the lock-free table
    auxiliary/bench/bench.lua      single-thread baseline benchmark harness (run!)
    auxiliary/bench/bench_mt.lua   multi-thread scaling benchmarks (post-M4)
    auxiliary/tests/*.lua          threading conformance + stress suite (post-M4)

The two `*_model.c` files are historical executable sketches. Their passing
tests do not establish paused-owner progress or absence of lost updates. In
particular, freezing a source value into `FORWARD` before publishing its
payload is not helpable. Extend or replace the model before porting a protocol
whose proof fails; preserve the semantic requirements, not an unsafe sketch.

### 0.4 Ground rules (binding)

1. **Platforms**: x86-64 Linux, macOS, and Windows; `LJ_GC64` is mandatory.
   Current work is Linux-first. Before the next release, validate macOS with
   Darling and Windows with Wine as well as native CI.
   Other architectures remain outside the requested scope. Original ADR-1's
   Linux-only restriction is superseded by the user's expanded scope.
2. **No compatibility flag wall**: the lockless runtime is the primary build
   path. Do not hide the implementation behind `LUAJIT_THREADSAFE`/`LJ_MT`, and
   do not preserve a parallel legacy path merely for flag-off compatibility.
   Keep temporary reference code only when a milestone explicitly needs it as
   an oracle or migration aid.
3. **No locks on hot paths.** pthread mutexes/condvars may appear only in:
   thread parking (futex wait inside channel recv / join / GC worker idle),
   one-time library initialization, and the panic path. A held lock may never
   cover any allocation, table operation, string interning, barrier, or any
   code reachable from the interpreter dispatch loop. Document any permitted
   blocking boundary in the code that owns it and cover observable behavior
   with fixtures. Document the allowed blocking boundaries beside the code that
   owns them.
4. **Every shared-memory access goes through `lj_atomic.h`.** No raw
   `volatile`, no bare loads/stores of shared fields. This both defines the
   semantics and makes ThreadSanitizer meaningful.
5. **No safepoint inside a lock-free critical sequence.** Table reads/writes,
   string interning, allocator fast paths and barrier bodies must not poll,
   allocate-with-GC, or call anything that can reach `lj_safepoint_poll`.
   This is the grace-period invariant that makes deferred reclamation sound
   (05 §5.9). Add the `LJ_NOSAFEPOINT` audit comments as specified.
6. **Keep design decisions accountable to evidence.** Preserve decisions
   whose correctness and cost remain supported. Correct or replace those
   contradicted by the current requirements, code, paused-owner schedules, or
   measurements, and record the reason plus the replacement's proof obligations.
7. **Measure before and after.** `auxiliary/bench/bench.lua` numbers from the
   reference machine are in 13 §13.2. Re-baseline on your machine at M0 and
   keep a CSV; the single-thread regression budget is ≤10% geomean
   (stretch ≤5%) on the lockless runtime with one thread running.

### 0.5 How to verify as you go

- `make -C src -j` after every task; run both `-joff` and `-jon` where the
  milestone exercises interpreter and JIT behavior separately.
- Run the stock behavior smoke: `src/luajit -e "require'ffi'; print(2^31)"`
  plus the test files listed per milestone.
- From M3 on, run the GC torture mode (`lj_gc2.c` exposes
  `collectgarbage("torture", 1)`: handshake after every N allocations) under
  the Lua test suite.
- From M4 on, run `auxiliary/tests/` and the TSAN build target (13 §13.6).
- Keep `git commit` granularity at one spec-section per commit; commit
  messages reference the section, e.g. `gc2: grey stack push/pop (05 §5.6)`.

### 0.6 Vocabulary used throughout

- **universe** — one `global_State` and everything it owns.
- **OS thread / mutator** — a kernel thread attached to the universe; runs
  exactly one `lua_State` at a time (its *current* coroutine).
- **TG block** — the per-OS-thread block the `DISPATCH` register points to
  (dispatch tables, hot counters, safepoint word, allocator, SSB, …); see 03.
- **handshake / round** — the GC asks every mutator to run a small action at
  its next safepoint and waits for all acks; "soft" because threads ack at
  their own pace and never stop each other. See 05 §5.4.
- **grey object** — marked, queued for tracing. **black** — marked and
  traced. Mark state lives in arena bitmaps, never in object bytes (05 §5.5).
- **cell** — a heap-allocated, always-closed upvalue (06 §6.4).
- **gen** (tables) — one immutable-identity node/array vector generation of a
  table; resize installs a new gen (06 §6.2–6.3).
- **pre-lockless dump** — bytecode dump with an older v2/v3 format. The
  current lockless loader accepts stock-compatible old dumps, rejects
  lockless-only cell opcodes in old versions, and refuses to re-dump
  legacy-loaded functions (10 §10.4).
