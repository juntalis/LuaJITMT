# 12. Implementation Plan — Milestones M0..M10

Your task list. Each milestone: goal → tasks (with spec refs) → tests →
acceptance gate. Do not start Mn+1 before Mn's gate is green. Estimated
diff sizes are for sanity-checking scope, not deadlines.

## M0 — Harness & Behavior Coverage (≈300 lines)
Tasks: pin the commit (00 §0.2). Add the ADR-1 x86-64/GC64 `#error`
invariant check without creating a compatibility flag wall. CI scripts: build
matrix {-joff,-jon}; stock test suite runner (import
github.com/LuaJIT/LuaJIT-test-cleanup tests into tests/stock/). CI must prove
builds, runtime behavior, public API/ABI compatibility, benchmark data, or
packaging output. Keep lasting invariants in behavior fixtures, C race/lifetime
fixtures, release/bytecode artifact checks where the artifact is the public
product, and code-adjacent comments plus notes when the rule is design guidance
rather than observable behavior. Run
`auxiliary/bench/bench.lua` on your machine, both -joff/-jon, 5 runs, commit CSV as
`bench/baseline_<host>.csv`.
Gate: default builds pass the stock suite; bench CSV committed.

## M1 — Atomics + state split, behavior-neutral (≈1500 lines)
Tasks: drop in `auxiliary/lj_atomic.h` as src/lj_atomic.h (verify it compiles
with gcc/clang on x86-64). Create lj_tg.h/.c with TGState (03
§3.2) embedded in GG_State; `g->jitp`; move tmpbuf/tmptv/tmptv2/prng/
cur_L/jit_base accessors through `G2TG`-style macros that resolve to the
embedded TG. Document the lasting tmpbuf/cur_L/jit_base ownership requirement
beside the helper/accessor layer.
02 §2.4 tv_rawstore macro
layer routes final 64-bit moves through `lj_atomic`. lj_mtfields.md seeded
(02 §2.5).
Gate: stock tests green; x64 VM behavior fixtures green before the dasc
migration.

## M2 — dasc migration + allocator swap, still single-thread (≈3000)
Tasks: vm_x64.dasc TG addressing per 03 §3.5 dispositions A–F. lj_arena.{h,c}
per 04 (port auxiliary/arena_bitmap_model.c verbatim for
bitmap/sweep/free-run code); retire lj_alloc.c body, keep low-address
mmap probing (04 §4.10); GCHeader change nextgc→gcw + gcflags (04 §4.7) —
this forces the lj_gc.c single-thread GC to switch sweep to arenas even in
the "legacy GC" path: DECIDED simpler: the legacy GC is no longer a
production object; M2 therefore brings up a degenerate gc2: STW-only mode
(leader runs mark+sweep with the world parked at a handshake — possible
with one thread trivially) so the system is collectable before M3 makes it
concurrent. The makefile object list moves from lj_gc.o/lj_alloc.o to
lj_gc2.o/lj_arena.o as that replacement lands.
Inline bump alloc in dasc (07 §7.5). Safepoint stub + poll sites compiled
but poll always 0 (07 §7.3).
Tests: stock suite (1 thread). Heap stress: tests/t-alloc-churn.lua
(alloc/free 10M mixed sizes, fragmentation walk). arena model asserts
already ran at M0 (it's standalone).
Gate: stock green; bench regression ≤8% at this stage (no barrier yet);
memory footprint within 1.3x of stock on t-alloc-churn.

## M3 — Concurrent GC, single mutator (≈4000)
Tasks: lj_safepoint.{h,c} full handshake machinery (05 §5.4); lj_gc2 full
(05 §5.3–5.13): mark/traverse ports (lj_gc.c functions listed in 05
§5.6.4 — port gc_traverse_* one by one), SSB, Chase-Lev deques, fixpoint
leader loop, lazy+worker sweep, defer_free epochs, pacing, torture,
LJ_GC2_PARANOIA STW-diff oracle (05 §5.13 — build this FIRST). Barrier:
add always-on C-side GC2 insertion hooks to the existing legacy barrier
macros first, preserving the legacy color barriers until their oracle role is
finished. Barrier ownership spans the C API, table/meta, function/state,
cdata/callback, vmevent, library, VM, and JIT paths; keep the lasting proof in
behavior fixtures, runtime stress, and comments beside the constrained helpers.
Add the dasc
`wbarrier_tv` macro plus TSET*/USET*
wiring (07 §7.4). Weak tables + finalizer queue minimal (full in M8).
collectgarbage mapping (05 §5.10).
Tests: stock under torture; paranoia build over the whole stock suite;
t-gc-01..06 (cycles under churn, weak basic, finalizer basic, resurrect,
huge objects, coroutine stacks).
Gate: paranoia oracle reports zero diffs across the suite; torture stock
green; bench (1 thread, GC concurrent) regression ≤10%.

Current implementation note: `threading.gcworkers(N)` exposes the staged
capped parked GC2 worker pool: missing `N` queries the current count, `N <= 0`
stops it, and positive `N` starts up to the current cap while returning the
previous count. Worker lifecycle changes are serialized by
`GC2State.worker_control`, with dead registry-visible worker TGs retired until
TG reclamation can unlink them; the full per-worker-deque pool remains the
original M3/M9 scheduler target.

## M4 — Threads exist: spawn/join/channels, JIT OFF (≈2500)
Tasks: lj_thr (pthread/futex shim), lib_threading + lj_chan per 09
(channel C unit test chan_stress.c FIRST, 13 §13.6.2); tg attach/detach
incl. mid-handshake attach (09 §9.3); thr_owner claims (06 §6.7, 03
§3.7); native-state enter/leave on blocking paths; HS_STOPREQ shutdown;
thread-activation latch (`global_State.mt_active`) + legacy-uv latch
behavior (10 §10.4, parser not yet changed — legacy machinery is what
exists, so the latch logic is exercisable immediately). This is runtime
state, not an `LJ_MT`/`LUAJIT_THREADSAFE` build gate.
Tests: t-api-01..10 (spawn/join/results/errors/timeout/close/rendezvous/
stress 1k threads sequential), t-mt-smoke (N threads pure-compute), 13
§13.3 litmus L1–L4 (message passing, join HB, fence SC, channel FIFO).
Gate: all green with `-joff`, 1..8 threads, under torture, 100 repetitions
of the litmus set; TSAN build of C unit drivers clean.

## M5 — Concurrent objects: tables/strings/cells (≈5000)
Tasks: tables per 06 §6.2–6.3 (port auxiliary/nbtab_model.c; GCtab reshape;
IRFL offset constants updated even though JIT still off for MT); string
intern rewrite 06 §6.5 (+ sweep wave ordering); parser cell model +
CNEW/CGET/CSET (06 §6.4, 07 §7.6, 10 §10.2–10.3); bcread/bcwrite v4 (10
§10.1, 10.5, 10.6); long tail 06 §6.8; per-TG math.random.
Tests: stock (the parser change touches *everything* — expect a long
debug tail here; use opaque bytecode dump/load execution, stock behavior
fixtures, and local-cell/upvalue behavior checks for v4-vs-v2 compatibility);
t-tab-01..08 (8-thread hammer suites: insert/
lookup/delete/resize/iterate/array-grow/mixed/len), t-str-01..03 (intern
storm, sweep-resurrect, resize race); nbtab_model + its in-tree port
share a fuzz seed corpus.
Gate: stock green (-joff); hammer suites 10-min soak
clean under torture; paranoia oracle still zero-diff; string identity
checker (intern 1M strings from 8 threads, assert pointer-equality per
content) passes.

## M6 — JIT on under the lockless runtime (≈4000)
Tasks: 08 in order: token (§8.2); registry RCU + bc_publish (§8.3–8.4.1);
exittab + assembler stub rows + trampoline (§8.4.2–8.4.3) — land the exit
indirection as a single-thread refactor first (stock JIT tests green + perf
delta ≤1%), then dual-map mcode (§8.5); XPOLL/XBAR IR + recording of
CGET/CSET (§8.6, §8.8); FLOAD hdr-indirection (§8.8.1); flush protocol
(§8.7).
Current implementation note: the original report's M6 task above remains the
canonical target. The current x86-64 bridge has implemented guarded `IR_XPOLL`
for LOOP-backedge trace safepoint polls and inlined FUNCF-depth entries. The
first TGMARK invalidation slice keeps `TBAR`/`OBAR` inside XPOLL-delimited
poll regions; broader XBAR invalidation work remains pending. The CGET/CSET
recording subtask is covered for the current x64 bridge by behavior fixtures
over raw-slot fallback, promoted-cell load/store behavior, GC-valued
publication, and source/loaded self-cell creation traces. The first
`BC_CNEW`/`BC_FNEW` helper-backed slice removed the CNEW-specific
`PROTO_NOJIT` gates. Mixed raw-local FNEW traces are now covered for
source/loaded immutable raw captures through stack-value synchronization,
mutable captures once the cell is promoted at trace entry, and source/loaded
first-promotion loops where the hot trace performs the first mutable raw-slot
promotion with otherwise type-stable loop slots. A narrow helper-backed
table-store bridge now records
in-bounds `ASTORE`/`HSTORE` updates on Linux/x64, including existing non-nil
slots, previous-nil slots, trace-local new string-key hash slots, and
trace-local new numeric slots, plus shared, PHI-carried, upvalue-carried,
escaped, and weak-table references. These lower through split hash/array/newref
helpers that run the parent-aware value barrier and the P_WEAK weak-write
bridge; M10 now also pins that traced helper-backed array stores enqueue the
old parent, not the young value, for idle generational remembered-set draining.
The x64 VM `TSETV`/`TSETB`/`TSETR`/`TSETM` fast array/range stores use
post-store publication helpers instead of pre-store black-table repair retry
branches, preserving the `TSETM` table barrier while the stored value snapshot
drives GC2 and legacy repair.
Active-MT recording no longer disables all new traces: secondary TGs can still
record numeric/non-table root and side traces, plus fresh table allocations,
under the recorder token. Helper-backed non-trace-local table loads/stores now
trace after `mt_active` for the covered raw-slot, previous-nil, new-key, array,
and hash cases. The remaining recorder-local table boundary is shared traversal:
direct `next()`/optimized `pairs()` and shared `ipairs_aux` over
non-trace-local shared tables stay interpreted until traversal has a versioned
or generation-following runtime contract and a result-shape contract across the
hidden cursor/result slots and exits.
The original generation-aware table write protocol and broader
AHdr/NHdr table-generation port remain pending.
Linux/x64 HREFK recording now avoids the legacy `GCtab.hmask` mirror
guard and relies on the loaded node pointer plus x64 node-header slot guard;
empty-hash misses fall through to regular `HREF` instead of the legacy
`TAB_HMASK == 0` shortcut. Shared array reads now have an interim x64
pair-stability guard that brackets the `TAB_ASIZE` bounds check with two fresh
`TAB_ARRAY` loads and guards the array pointers equal before `AREF`/`ALOAD`.
Separated shared array reads now use `TabArrayHdr.asize` loaded through the
single recorded `GCtab.array` slots pointer; colocated shared arrays keep the
legacy pair guard. The header path checks the observed slots pointer so a
split-from-colocated publication window does not treat colocated storage as a
header-backed allocation, and runtime guards exit for `NULL`/colocated array
pointers before the header load. Separated visible-size changes now publish
fresh array-header generations; shrink generations preserve capacity for stale
mirror readers but nil hidden tail slots. GC/GC2 traversal, table-size
accounting, and table free now derive separated-array capacity from the array
header snapshot rather than `GCtab.acap`. This leaves the broader
table-generation model pending around legacy mirrors, remaining owner-side
C mirror readers, and helper-backed stores.
Helper-backed Linux/x64 `ASTORE`/`HSTORE` stores now pass the array index or
hash key into their helpers and resolve before CAS if the recorded slot is
outside the current generation; `NEWREF` stores key-resolve before each CAS.
Public/runtime C stores with parent/key context now use the same keyed CAS
validation, retrying stale old-generation destinations before returning to Lua.
This closes the stale retiring-generation slot case for the converted helper
and C store surfaces while the broader generated RETIRING/FORWARD/CAS write
protocol remains pending.
Linux/x64
secure builds now use the original M6 dual-map mcode write view: each mcode
area is memfd-backed, mapped once RX and once RW, `MCLink.rw` carries the
writable alias, generated-code/unwind writes go through RX/RW translation
helpers, and teardown unmaps both aliases. The M9 cleanup removed the
conservative fresh-area bridge; reserve now reuses the current dual-map area
through its RW alias after publication, and new areas are allocated only on
normal mcode exhaustion. Recorder-internal `LJ_TRLINK_RETURN` call-unroll flushes now
use `lj_trace_flushscope()`, sharing the public scoped `HS_EXIT_TRACES` boundary
and slot-retirement path instead of leaving marked scoped slots behind. Numeric
side-trace flushes now mark and retire the named side slot through the same
boundary while preserving the root trace.
Tests: stock with -jon; t-jit-01..06 (trace same loop from 2 threads;
side-trace attach while parent runs on another thread; flush storm;
exit-handler stress; recording-thread killed mid-trace (error in
recorder); stitching). Scaling: bench_mt.lua first real numbers.
Gate: stock -jon green; single-thread JIT bench regression
≤10% geomean vs M0 CSV (THE gate of the project); t-jit suite 10-min soak.

## M7 — FFI (≈2000)
Tasks: 11 §11.2–11.7. Order: CTState RCU (unit-test ctype_stress.c),
cdata alloc switch, ffi.gc registry, native-state wrapping + fast-call
exemption, callbacks attach, clib.
Tests: t-ffi-01..06 (11 §11.8); stock FFI tests under torture, 8 threads.
Gate: green; ffi_struct bench within 10% of M0.

Current implementation note: the original M7 target above remains intact.
FINREG uses CAS-published weak-key generations for cdata finalizer registry
growth, and recorded `ffi.gc()`/ctype `__gc` now emits the FINREG mutation
helper instead of falling back to NYI. The current behavior coverage exercises direct
registration, nil clear, metatype registration, and multi-threaded default-JIT
FINREG stress; the broader final FINREG/finqueue execution design remains M8
follow-up rather than M9 performance cleanup. x64 callback runtime scratch is
per TG; callback entry chooses the current TLS carrier for attached callers and
auto-attaches a hidden callback carrier for TLS-less foreign pthread entry.
Callback slot claiming creates that hidden carrier only after observing a free
owner slot, so slot-table overflow stays on the existing error path without
allocating an unclaimable carrier.

## M8 — Weak tables & finalizers, complete semantics (≈1200)
Tasks: full gc_mayclear rule port (05 §5.8), resurrection-race store hook,
finalizer thread + ordering, ffi.gc interplay, __gc on tables? (5.1: only
udata/cdata — keep), lua_close finalization drain (09 §9.6).
Tests: t-weak-01..05 (k/v/kv modes, resurrection, cycle of weak tables,
finalizer ordering, finalizer that spawns a thread).
Gate: paranoia oracle extended to weak sets, zero-diff.

Current implementation note: the original M8 target above remains intact.
`tools/ci/lua_test.sh m8_weak` now covers deterministic weak-mode semantics,
string weak-reference parity, weak-table cycles, current `ffi.gc()` ordering
and clear/nested-GC behavior, close-time cdata/userdata finalizer drain, and
focused GC2 weak/barrier paranoia coverage. It also reruns the GC2 phase
accounting test to assert finalizer owner tracking and enter/leave counter
balance under the current bridge. The traversal gate now covers
`lj_gc2_weak_complete()` skip/backfill/fallback accounting for the current
GC2-cleared snapshot bridge, captured traversal-time weak modes across later
`mt.__mode` mutation in both drain and late-write barriers, and a post-clear
weak-phase store hook for the original resurrection-race case, including VM
rewrites of existing nil-valued weak-key hash slots and VM insertion of strong
hash keys into weak-value tables. VM table-valued `__newindex` stores now use
the resolved owner for weak-value late-write marking after the slot CAS.
`table.insert()` direct array writes now use the same weak-write bridge for
weak-value tables during `P_WEAK`, and direct C API raw setters are covered for
all-weak hash and weak-value array writes.
The weak-clear bridge now treats a current-cycle GC2 mark from a pre-drain
late write as authoritative over stale legacy white during `GCSatomic`, keeping
the original weak-table semantics target while avoiding a larger plan change.
Paranoia builds now rescan the legacy weak list after a GC2 skip decision and
fail if any weak slot remains clearable.
Finalizer dispatch now has a GC2 owner try-claim around legacy
finalizer draining, so peer TGs back off instead of racing the shared finalizer
state while close-time drains still complete through the blocking wrapper. The
older `finalizer_token` bridge has been removed, and normal finalizer producers
publish through the GC2 MPSC/consumer-ring bridge instead of legacy `mmudata`;
that bridge now links dedicated queue nodes instead of overwriting each pending
object's `gcw` root/list link. Dispatch-time queue consumption goes through
GC2's internal `lj_gc2_finalizer_dispatch_one()`, leaving legacy GC with only
public dispatch-all/step entry points rather than callback-runner,
owner/drain/dequeue, or dequeued-object routing access. Close-time
drain-all uses `lj_gc2_finalizer_dispatch_all()`, so the blocking drain /
queue-pending / dispatch-one loop also stays in GC2. Incremental
`GCSfinalize` work uses `lj_gc2_finalizer_step()`, moving queue checks, trace
deferral, cost accounting, and finalizer-spawn deferral into GC2 while legacy GC
retains only the sweep-close state transition.
User finalizer callbacks now run on the claimed collector caller `lua_State`
instead of the shared `vmthread(g)` stack. Userdata FINREG membership now uses a
GC2 side list for discovery, including in-place metatable finalizer additions
and manually chain-unlinked userdata; `lj_gc2_finreg_udata_finalize()` owns the
side-list walk and finalizer queue publication, while
`lj_gc2_finreg_udata_dispatch()` owns dispatch-time FINREG clear, object
requeue/rewhite, `__gc` lookup, and protected callback execution. Cdata
ordered FINREG discovery covers the ordinary P_WEAK and close-time paths, and
`lj_gc2_finreg_cdata_dispatch()` owns dispatch-time FINREG slot/preclaim
resolution, object requeue/rewhite, and protected callback execution. GC2
also owns close-time FINREG generation disable through
`lj_gc2_finreg_cdata_disable()`. The M9 cleanup removed close-time
generation-table pending/discovery scans; P_WEAK preclaim side-vector failure
now restores and queues the same ordered object without a legacy root-list walk.
The GC2 FINREG root helper layer owns the cdata FINREG generation/preclaim root
walks: legacy GC enters through `lj_gc2_finreg_cdata_mark_roots()`, and GC2 keeps
preclaims in pending roots while marking FINREG generations from the FFI global
root path. Collector-specific callbacks preserve each marker's coloring
semantics.
Queued finalizer marking now routes through `lj_gc2_finalizer_mark_all()`, so
GC2 owns the finalizer owner claim, producer-stack drain, and stable ring walk
while legacy marking callbacks preserve classic collector coloring semantics.
If cdata with a live finalizer reaches sweep/free, that is now a fatal FINREG
invariant instead of a rescue queue; safety and Lua finalizer semantics win over
trying to recover from a missed owner edge.
The broader planned FINREG/finqueue dispatch path remains M8 work rather than
an M9 performance cleanup.
The original "finalizer that spawns a thread" item now has bridge tests for
spawn+join during explicit-GC finalization and for a worker that outlives the
callback; the latter defers the full-GC loop back to the mutator instead of
waiting forever on `mt_live`, and explicit `collectgarbage("step", ...)` no
longer reports cycle completion while that spawned worker is still live. The M8
gate also runs a reduced `t-ffi-gc-finreg.lua` smoke so worker-created FINREG
finalizers must fire exactly once under interpreter and default-JIT modes. The
broader planned async finalizer dispatch path remains M8 work, not an M9
performance cleanup.
New-object allocation now avoids direct global root-list CAS on the common
path. Fresh objects publish to a TG-local pending stack through
`lj_gc_linkobj_new()`, and legacy root-list consumers drain those stacks before
sweep/unlink/verification. Existing-object root requeues stay immediate. This
is an interim bridge; the remaining target is still arena bitmap identity and
bitmap-only sweep instead of legacy root-chain sweep.

## M9 — Performance closing (open-ended; budget ≈2000)
Menu (in expected-value order; measure each): per-arena grey stacks +
priority queue (05 §5.6.3); inline-alloc IR on trace (08 §8.6); cell
sinking (08 §8.8.4); bump-window policy tuning (04 §4.4); barrier
hoisting quality (XBARFLG CSE region sizing); TG layout cache-line audit
(perf c2c); bridge cleanup for temporary tokens/owner claims/locks that are
not part of the final design, especially leftover temporary locks and tokens;
channel spin K tuning; sweep SIMD (the bitmap identities vectorize — 04 §4.1.1).
Accepted serialized surfaces are `ffi.cdef`, `require`, and the serialized
recorder/recorder token; do not spend M9 trying to make those parallel unless a
correctness issue demands it.
Gate: ≤10% single-thread geomean (stretch 5%); bench_mt scaling ≥6x on
8 cores for tab_read-shared and arith-MT; GC pause P99 (owner-side,
mutator-observed poll acknowledgements) <500µs on the churn bench.

Current implementation note: `threading.gcstats()` now returns a
benchmark-facing table of GC2 counters for cycle starts, requested vs actual
minor cycles, allocation pacing, poll-ack latency, assist/worker progress, owner
sweep progress, weak clearing, weak-write marks, FINREG fallback/order counters,
finalizer queueing/MPSC drains, finalizer-spawn deferrals, and live estimates.
`lib_base.c` formats the Lua table from `GC2StatsSnapshot`, while
`lj_gc2_stats_snapshot()` owns the GC2 acquire-load boundary for the exported
counters.
`plan/auxiliary/bench/bench_mt.lua` prints a stable subset of those fields after a run
and reports approximate owner-side poll-ack P99 latency from histogram deltas;
synthetic leader and remote-native acknowledgements do not contribute to the
poll-latency histogram.
Run `tools/ci/lua_test.sh m9_m10_gc` to aggregate the M9 stats smoke, M9
benchmark smoke, and M10 generational coverage.

## M10 — Generational mode (≈800)
Tasks: 05 §5.12 (minor sweep identity already in arena code from M2;
remembered-set SSB mode; heuristic switch; `threading.gcmode("generational")`).
Gate: alloc_tables bench ≥1.5x vs M9 full-cycle mode; paranoia (major
after minor) zero-diff.

Current implementation note: the fork-local `threading.gcmode("generational")`
/ `threading.gcmode("incremental")` mode toggle now drives a passive
`GC2State.generational` bit and exposes it through `threading.gcstats()`.
Full GC now sets a one-shot major override, and generational mark begins record
minor-cycle requests through `minor_cycle_requests`; fully minor starts are
counted separately by `minor_cycle_starts` once the minor sweep/root gates latch.
Idle generational barriers conservatively queue remembered entries into SSB
without draining outside a cycle and force a major on overflow. Minor sweep and
root gates turn on after the first forced major baseline. Completed minor cycles
now estimate young survival from live-estimate growth over sampled cycle
allocation bytes and request a one-shot major at high survival. `bench.lua`
accepts `BENCH_GC_MODE` and `BENCH_SCALE` for M10 tuning probes; the initial 80
percent survival threshold leaves short-lived allocation churn on minor cycles
and promotes retained-allocation churn back to major collection. The M10 C
harness now exercises both interpreted VM-fast and traced helper-backed table
stores under idle generational mode and verifies the remembered entry is the old
parent table before the next minor cycle marks the young child.
